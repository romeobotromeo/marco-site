### 3. Day Job / Dirtbag Branding

- "Expensive but not corporate"
- Self-aware, a bit punk, polished

## Key Direction

**Positioning:** We're a web designer. Should look hipper than most.

**Tone:** Cheeky. Ironic. Self-aware MOCKERY of junk mail. Not earnest — a designer's wink at the aesthetic.

**Palette (STRICT):**
- Red: #E63025 (primary)
- Blue: #1B4EA0 (accent)
- Yellow: #FFD426 (highlights)
- White/Cream: backgrounds
- Black: text only

**Typography:**
- Archivo Black: Headlines, bold moments
- Instrument Sans: Body, clean readability
- Permanent Marker: Accent/hand-drawn moments (sparingly)

**Fonts approved** — keep current choices, some hand-painted style for accents only.

## Feedback on v1

- Concept ✓ | Execution ✗
- "Would be a good idea if Day Job designed it with Josh's direction"
- Missing craft details, polish, confidence
- Flow and sections are good — keep
- Needs to COMMIT harder to the bit

## Changes in v2

1. Strict red/blue/yellow/white palette (removed greens)
2. Cleaner typography hierarchy
3. More confident, less chaotic
4. Better spacing and breathing room
5. Phone mockup for demo section
6. Simplified comparison table
7. Polished CTA
8. Ironic postal header kept but refined
