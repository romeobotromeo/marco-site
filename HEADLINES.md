## The $2300 Angle (Feb 9 - David the plumber)

- "Stop paying $2300 for websites."
- "Your $2300 web developer hates this."
- "A website shouldn't cost a month's rent."
- "Text. Get a site. Keep $2,290."
- "David paid $2300. You don't have to."

## Notes
- Desktop should look like iOS app / phone mockup
- "Desktop = billboard for mobile"
